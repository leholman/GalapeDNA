##README FROM ALEX'S EMAIL 21JAN2021

mean_lon/mean_lat : the average latitude/longitude of all particles.
mean_dist : the direct line distance this is from the sample release point.
mean_spread : the average of the distances particles are from the mean_lon/mean_lat position
area : the surface area occupied by the particles (this only considers grid squares with > 50 particles in - 0.0001 of the release total)
ave_dist : the average of the individual particle direct line distances from the release point
cent_lon/cent_lat : the mid point of the particle spread polygon (again only considers grid squares with  > 50 particles in)
